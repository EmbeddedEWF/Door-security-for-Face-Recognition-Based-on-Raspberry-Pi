# Face-recognition
This project is based on the face recognition intelligent Door security of Raspberry Pie, which uses Python to change the door switch to LED on/off, and users can change the steering gear or other products to achieve their desired functions. The project code files are in the project, and these files in the directory at this level are all project process files. Among them, operate.md is the actual operation process of the project, and the images are all in the assets folder. This directory also includes the experimental results video of the final project for reference.
